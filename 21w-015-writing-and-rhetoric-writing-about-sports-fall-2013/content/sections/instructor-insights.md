Course Overview
---------------

This page focuses on the course _21W.015 Writing and Rhetoric: Writing About Sports_ as it was taught by Dr. Karen Boiko in Fall 2013.

This course was one in a suite of introductory writing subjects, aimed primarily at freshmen. The course aimed to improve students’ communication skills by having them continually write and rewrite pieces, along with editing their peers’ writing. The curriculum focused on reading, discussing, writing, and giving oral presentations on issues related to sports and their role as a significant part of American culture.

Instructor Insights
-------------------

_Below, Karen Boiko describes various aspects of how she taught _21W.015 Writing and Rhetoric: Writing About Sports_._

I developed this course as a new “flavor” in the Writing and Rhetoric series, because I thought the topic would interest undergraduates. Students seem to respond well to the course, as they seem to enjoy being able to write about a topic that is important to them and relevant to their daily lives.

The main challenge for this class was preventing the class from turning into simple “sports writing.” To prevent this, I ensured the selected readings all engaged with ideas and issues instead of merely being description and narration.

Student Information
-------------------

![15 students took this course when it was offered in Fall 2013.](/coursemedia/21w-015-writing-and-rhetoric-writing-about-sports-fall-2013/7674b6458ad6a5497f8f75575e73394d_21W-015_stat-students.png)

### Breakdown by Year

Mostly freshmen, with a few upperclassmen.

### Typical Student Background

Most students had a previous interest in sports and had either played sports in high school or at MIT.

### Enrollment Cap

18

### Ideal Class Size

Limiting the class to 12-15 students is ideal because responding to student writing is intensive. It is difficult to give students sufficient time in class to have their writing discussed if the class size is large.

How Student Time Was Spent
--------------------------

During an average week, students were expected to spend 12 hours on the course, roughly divided as follows:

In Class
--------

*   Met 2 times a week for 1.5 hours per session; 26 sessions total; mandatory attendance.
*   Sessions primarily consisted of discussions of readings, workshops for writing pieces, and peer review of pieces. Lectures were minimal and rare.

Out of Class
------------

*   Students completed readings outside of class. The readings were meant to exemplify good writing on sports-related topics, to serve as inspiration to the students.
*   Students completed a series of writing assignments themed around sports to introduce them to writing and reviewing as subjects.
*   Students prepared oral presentations in the form of book reviews on books chosen from a given list.
